Soundscape is a music-sharing social platform that allows users to post what they are listening to along with the associated location and optional comment. Soundscape creates a map-based feed of music sharing personal moments. This enables users to discover music through friend's real world experiences. Users will be able to link music provider apps, such as Spotify, to their Soundscape account in order to create posts with a song they are listening to, their location, and a description. Soundscape combines music-sharing, location posting, and social interaction into a personal and engaging experience.
